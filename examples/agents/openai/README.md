# OpenAI Agent Example

This example demonstrates how to use the [Flame](https://github.com/xflops/flame) SDK to deploy an AI agent powered by the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python).

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [FlamePy](https://github.com/xflops/flame) (`flamepy`) >= 0.5.0
- [openai](https://pypi.org/project/openai/) >= 2.8.1
- [openai-agents](https://pypi.org/project/openai-agents/) >= 0.6.1

## Files

- `apis.py`: Shared data classes for both the agent and its client.
- `agent.py`: Example agent implementation built with the OpenAI Agents SDK and Flame SDK.
- `client.py`: Client code that communicates with the agent via the Flame API.

## Usage

### 1. Setup Flame Cluster

In the Flame root directory, start a development cluster using `docker compose`:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Check the cluster's status:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Expected output:

```bash
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                           COMMAND               CREATED            STATUS            PORTS                   NAMES
dd76fcaa904d  localhost/xflops/flame-session-manager:latest                         About an hour ago  Up About an hour  0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp  flame_flame-session-manager_1
b635c3e0fcad  localhost/xflops/flame-executor-manager:latest                        About an hour ago  Up About an hour                          flame_flame-executor-manager_1
4cf654580916  localhost/xflops/flame-console:latest           service ssh start...  About an hour ago  Up About an hour                          flame_flame-console_1
```

Then, log into the console container to run the example:

```bash
docker exec -it flame_flame-console_1 /bin/bash
cd /opt/examples/agents/openai/
```

### 2. Set DeepSeek API Key

Update `openai-agent.yaml` to add your DeepSeek API key, then register the agent in Flame:

```bash
flmctl register -f openai-agent.yaml
```

### 3. Run the Client

```bash
uv run client.py apis.py
```

## Example Output

```bash
# uv run client.py apis.py
